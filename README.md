# Feature-Selection
The objective of this project is to assess the impact of feature selection on training and test datasets.  
Two datasets accompany this assignment
​SPECT_train.csv 
​ SPECT_test.csv. 
The idea is to identify good feature subsets using the training dataset and test these subsets on the test data.
